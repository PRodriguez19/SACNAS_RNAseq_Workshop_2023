# SACNAS_RNAseq_Workshop_2023

## Description 
This repository has teaching materials for an Introduction to RNA-sequencing data analysis. This unit focuses on teaching basic computational skills to enable the effective use of an high-performance computing environment to implement an RNA-seq data analysis workflow. In addition to running the RNA-seq workflow from FASTQ files to count data, this unit covers best practice guidelines for RNA-seq experimental design and data organization/management.

## Learning Objectives 

1. Understand the necessity for, and use of, the command line interface (bash) and HPC for analyzing high-throughput sequencing data.
2. Understand best practices for designing an RNA-seq experiment and analysis the resulting data.
